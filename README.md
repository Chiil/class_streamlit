This code runs with

`python -m streamlit run class_streamlit.py`

Once the code is running and the Streamlit server is active, you can send a case via URL.

First, example input data needs to be generated:

`python make_example_sounding.py`

Then, the case can be launched using:

`python run_class_from_url.py`
